Five man deep in this four door truck
It's showtime, I like the turnout
Spin-spin ting so weighty
Back it, it comin' like a tricep workout
How many drugs got served out?
Spend that cash on skengs
Took a hoody, crep and shirt out
Been tryna leave an opp boy curl out
Drown my clothes in so much petty
That nearly the whole car got burned out
That's a real dilemma, no Kelly, Nelly
Back that blade, get cheffy
Headshot, tryna shave man's memory
Sergeant seen me in the station
No way that's Headie, another attempted?
On the blower to my bro, he Turkish
He know I'm tryna make a purchase
Take so much tools to the opp block
You'd think that the gang refurbished
Night bar with the dirty and a press machine
One leather on my tracksuit, Burberry
Bad B said I ain't doin' too bad considerin' I was on servery

(Bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet)
Don't watch no face
They already know my ting laced
Big bludclart gauge
Big .45 'pon the waist
Try and test a firma [?]
Man'll serve them blocks like a [?]
'Nuff money a mek' from my day
Drill and trap, just so we stay
Don't watch no face
They already know my ting laced
Big bludclart gauge
Big .45 'pon the waist
Try and test a firma [?]
Man'll serve them blocks like a [?]
'Nuff money a mek' from my day
Drill and trap, just so we stay

Niggas know how I move on the pavements
In the jail, what I do to the paigons
Don't care about adjudications
Tell guards 'leave me alone' like Wonga
Talking 'bout two weeks basic
Like I ain't been in the T house longer
I was flipping this weight
You was in gym with your mate tryna see who's stronger
Me and these niggas ain't the same
I'm feelin' like Mist
Guns, knives, fists
Either way, you're pissed
If I didn't score that point on the opps
I was definitely apart of the assist
I'm about to go cop me a AP
Feds still tryna put cuffs on my wrists
I'm fresh out the slammer
Can't abide by the law
I just grab my hammer
And hit the other side like I'm Thor
How many times did I sweep on the opp block?
And I weren't tryna do chores
Spin-spin ting got filled with teeth like the inside of your jaw

(Bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet)
Don't watch no face
They already know my ting laced
Big bludclart gauge
Big .45 'pon the waist
Try and test a firma [?]
Man'll serve them blocks like a [?]
'Nuff money a mek' from my day
Drill and trap, just so we stay
Don't watch no face
They already know my ting laced
Big bludclart gauge

Try and test a firma [?]
Man'll serve them blocks like a [?]
'Nuff money a mek' from my day
Drill and trap, just so we stay
