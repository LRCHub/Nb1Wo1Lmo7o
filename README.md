```
I want you to steal my night
注ぐ wine
溢れるほど
I can read your mind
Boy you're mine
You want me right now
It's tonight
Take the time
Keep it up
Keep it up yea
Give me that
Give me that now
Steal my night
アツくなる
触れるほど
I can read your mind
Boy you're mine
You want me right now
It's tonight
Take the time
Keep it up
Keep it up yea
Give me that
Give me that now
Dance with me baby
埋めたいこのSpace
上に乗るBed
重ねるその手
今ならI know what you want
さよならすら曖昧なまま
触れられない程Deep
その態度も空回り
揺れるLate night  君のせいで
これがゲームなら　I don't wanna play
過ぎてく24   溶ける君はSnow
そこには何も No  you don't know
I don't wanna be alone
言えない事も言う
Cuz I wanna know more about you
I want you to steal my night
注ぐ wine
溢れるほど
I can read your mind
Boy you're mine
You want me right now
It's tonight
Take the time
Keep it up
Keep it up yea
Give me that
Give me that now
Steal my night
アツくなる
触れるほど
I can read your mind
Boy you're mine
You want me right now
It's tonight
Take the time
Keep it up
Keep it up yea
Give me that
Give me that now
揺れるBady & VVS Chain
知り合う度 埋まるSpace
罪の数だけ増えてくTears
嘘と思うなら試せばいい
止めれない俺このBeatの上
手札を揃えてPlayするGame
2人の間で彷徨うTime
君が揺れる度失う Mind Ctrl
ビルが作りだすContrast City
時を刻んでる手首のRolly
過ぎてく度また増えてくPlaylist
全部すればいい俺のせいに
セリフも忘れる程に
ShakeするBody like want me
満ちてく夜明けがSlowに
全て奪うこれ以上無い程に
過ぎてく24  溶ける君はSnow
そこには何も No  you don't know
I don't wanna be alone
言えない事も言う
Cuz I wanna know more about you
I want you to steal my night
注ぐ wine
溢れるほど
I can read your mind
Boy you're mine
You want me right now
It's tonight
Take the time
Keep it up
Keep it up yea
Give me that
Give me that now
Steal my night
アツくなる
触れるほど
I can read your mind
Boy you're mine
You want me right now
It's tonight
Take the time
Keep it up
Keep it up yea
Give me that
Give me that now
