Ya, 11:55
Think about hittin' those hitting your phone line
I've been hella busy you just want them old times
Back before all the studio sessions and show times
Before it was lit, before everybody wanted a pic
When I was taking all them shots and breaks
I was very consistent, spoiled child, I see what I want and I get it
From Vallejo to Oakland, on mission
My old bitch in my sub-conscious, still trippin'
Time and time again, you proved you something, she isn't
Hold a nigga down, you the walking law of physics
Little piece of heaven, little sweet candy kisses

Tell me what you need, love
You deserve anything you could think of
I can't say I'll be flawless, but at least I know what my flaw is
So, I just wanna open up more
(I just wanna open up more)
That's something I'm working on
(That's something I'm working on)
I don't wanna look back, and then look bad again (looked bad again)
I've dealt with that hurt before
(I've dealt with that hurt before)
Why is this so new to me like, you're my first love
Baby you are, and I just realized
This is love with no disguise (this is)

Butter brown kisses
You're the only nigga on my wishlist
Love the way you finish every sentence
I've been out my mind now, I've been in my feelings
I'm tryna relax with you
I'm on the 5-80 heading back to you
My bitches say I'm crazy, I've been acting different lately
I had to tell'em hold up bitch, look I ain't asking you
If you were mine, all of the time
I'd be the love of your life forever
When we wake up, and then we go grind, and than we come back
And we shine together
Tell me what it's gonna be?
Tell me that you'll always gonna stay true
And Imma be, Imma be your inner peace
Really I could, really I could save you
Yeah yeah
But I need you to open up more (open up more)
That's something I"m working on
(That's something I"m working on)

I just wanna open up more
(I just wanna open up more)
That's something I'm working on
(That's something I'm working on)
I don't wanna look back, and I looked bad again (looked back again)
I've dealt with that hurt before

There's nothing, no substance to it

You know, we're missing value
Everything that gots value got some kind of sunstance to it
